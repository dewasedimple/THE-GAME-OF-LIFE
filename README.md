# THE-GAME-OF-LIFE
In the Game of Life, we have a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The grid wraps around, so cells on the edge have neighbors on the opposite edge. The game proceeds in generations, with each generation being a new configuration of live and dead cells based on certain rules.

Here's a summary of what the game is all about :

The Game of Life is a cellular automaton where you have a grid of cells, each of which can be in one of two states: alive or dead. The game evolves in generations, with each generation determined by the state of the cells in the previous generation. The rules dictate how cells live, die, or reproduce based on the number of neighboring cells. Despite its simple rules, the game can exhibit complex and unpredictable behavior, often producing intricate patterns and structures. Players can observe the evolution of these patterns over time, making it both a fascinating simulation and a creative tool for exploring emergent phenomena.
 
 This is how we implemented it through code :
1.It initializes variables such as the size of the grid, whether the game is currently playing, and the timing for each generation.

2.It creates and initializes two grids (grid and nextGrid) to represent the current state of the cells and the next state that will be calculated.

3.Functions are defined to handle various aspects of the game, such as initializing the grids, creating the HTML table to display the grid, handling cell clicks to toggle cell states, updating the view to reflect changes in the grid, and setting up control buttons for starting, pausing, clearing, and randomizing the grid.

4.The main logic of the game is implemented in the computeNextGen function, which calculates the next generation of cells based on Conway's rules:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
Any live cell with two or three live neighbors survives to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overcrowding).
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).
The applyRules function checks the neighbors of each cell and applies the rules to determine the next state of that cell.

5.The countNeighbors function counts the number of live neighbors for a given cell.
